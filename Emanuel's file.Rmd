## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
mnsolar <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rachelpercy/COMP112_project/main/mnsolar5.csv')
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(openintro)
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r}
mnsolar %>% 
  group_by(`Utility Type`) %>% 
  summarise(total_category = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = `Utility Type`, 
                 y = total_category))+
    geom_col()+
  labs(title = "Utility Type",
       x = "",
       y = "Quantity")
```

```{r}
mnsolar %>% 
  mutate(`Incentive Program`= str_squish(str_to_lower(`Incentive Program`))) %>% 
  group_by(`Customer Type`,  `Utility Type`) %>% 
  summarise(total_cat = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(`Utility Type`))+
  geom_bar()+
  facet_wrap(vars(`Customer Type`))
 # ggplot()+
  #geom_bar()
#Total incentive programs  
#Customer Type and incentive program 

#make all the incentive programs lowercase

#  facet by customer type , bar by utility type
#fill by utility type (no legend)
```


```{r}
#Top incentive program 
mnsolar %>% 
  mutate(`Incentive Program`= str_squish(str_to_lower(`Incentive Program`))) %>% 
  group_by( `Incentive Program`) %>% 
  summarise(total_cat = n()) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(aes( y = `Incentive Program`,
            x = total_cat))

```
